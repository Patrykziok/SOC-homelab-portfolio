## 1. Analysis Setup & Identification
I started by checking the file's reputation. **HashMyFiles** gave me the fingerprint, and **VirusTotal** confirmed it's a "RedLine Stealer".
SHA-256 hash for this sample is ab82c433b4a5e763de3427295657629780fa2157f0db9975c643ba4610b5d885

## 2. Malware Execution & System Impact
When I ran the malware, **Process Hacker** showed it using **PowerShell** to scan my system.


This screenshot from Process Hacker capture the exact moment of infection. The malware spawned multiple PowerShell instances, with one consuming over 31% of the CPU to harvest data. Simultaneously, the process schtasks.exe was observed, confirming the malware's attempt to establish persistence via the Task Scheduler.

Process Monitor confirmed that powershell.exe (PID 8988) accessed critical system DLLs (ntdll.dll, kernel32.dll) to interact with the OS at a low level

## 3. Registry & Filesystem Changes
I used **Regshot** to see what changed. The malware made 582 changes to the system.

* **Persistence:** It created a hidden folder called "Updates" in the registry.

## 4. Network Isolation
I used **Wireshark** to monitor traffic. Since I used a **LAN Segment**, the malware couldn't talk to its Command & Control server.

## 5. Persistence & Stealth
The malware created a **Scheduled Task** to run every time Windows starts.

* **Hidden File:** The malicious task was configured to execute %AppData%\Roaming\mviXtlzGrZrBSb.exe
* **Evasion:** Even with "Hidden Items" on, the file was invisible in the folder.

## 6. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
* **File Hash (SHA-256):** ab82c433b4a5e763de3427295657629780fa2157f0db9975c643ba4610b5d885
* **Malicious Process:** powershell.exe (High CPU usage, DLL access)
* **Dropped Executable:** %AppData%\Roaming\mviXtlzGrZrBSb.exe
* **Persistence Task:** Scheduled Task named "Updates"
